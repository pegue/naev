   <description>By modulating the frequency of the basic laser, the Empire military increased its range, accuracy and destructive power. After reworking the power conduits, their efforts culminated in the devastating Ripper. Further revision to this design brought the Ripper MK2, though it still shares the original's heavy power demands.</description>

   <description>Ion pulses were originally intended only to deactivate shields, which had completely nullified older radiation-based weaponry. It was thought that by figuring out a way to disable shields quickly, the radiation weapons would still be able to destroy the armour. By combining shield and armour destruction power, the perfect weapons could be designed. Ultimately, the ion pulses were highly effective against both armour and shields, rendering radiation-based weapons obsolete. With the latest generation of shields and armour materials, ion pulses have lost much of the terrain they had as newfound technology.</description>

   <description>The heavy ion turret uses a more powerful generator for each of its two ion cannons, giving each more punch than a lone ion cannon. The drawback is that this increases the power consumption considerably. Given their intended mounting on capital ships, their power consumption is eclipsed by the firepower they provide.</description>

   <description>Plasteel was one of man's greatest improvements on materials. It's a cheap, very strong armour that seems to take the best from both plastic and steel. You can bend it relatively easily while keeping its incredible strength. The Second Growth was only possible with this amazing new material.
By adding a dense layer of Plasteel to your ship you can increase its sturdiness substantially. Although with the advent of newer materials Plasteel is starting to fade in popularity, its lower price point maintains a loyal customer base.</description>

   <description>Nanobond is the successor to Plasteel. It follows the same approach but has a greatly refined manufacturing process, providing greater particle density. The result is a much more robust material, although it is substantially more expensive.</description>

   <description>Biometal is a metal armour that regenerates itself due to genetically-engineered bacteria throughout it. Due to the compartmentalization to permit bacterial life, and the difficulty of culturing the bacteria, Biometal has greater bulk than alternatives, and is the most expensive hull plating. The results are formidable, but it's hard to equip such armour on anything short of a Destroyer.</description>

   <description>This low maintenance droid crew will scour your ship to repair any damages caused by space hazards. They are very small and able to work both on the interior or exterior of the ship. Power is drawn from the ship to feed the robots, although the load is generally very low compared to the benefits of having a robotic repair crew.</description>

   <description>The immense class III reactor provides enough power for nearly anything. The technology used in this reactor is particularly groundbreaking, with the best energy density of the three reactor classes. The huge size of the class III results in it only fitting comfortably on large vessels, though its energy output would be excessive for anything less.</description>
